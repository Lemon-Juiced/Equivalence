# Lemon's Equivalence

## To obtain something, something of equal value must be lost. That is Alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange.
This mod allows you to harness the power of alchemy for yourself and transmute items to other items that are equal invalue.

Inspired by *Equivalent Exchange* mods and *ProjectE*. (This mod can be considered a Lite Version of them)

## Dependencies
- Versions 1.0.2+ of this mod require Java 16. You should update to Java 16 regardless, because Minecraft itself now runs on Java 16.
- [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
- Minecraft Versions
  - Minecraft 1.16 (v1.0.0, v1.0.1)
  - Minecraft 1.17 (v1.0.2 to v1.2.2)

## Planned Features
- Currently, the Philosopher's Stone returns a Discharged Stone when used in a Crafting Recipe. Fabric's limitations make it hard to return itself, though hopefully I can work around it and find a way. (If you are familiar with Fabric and know a solution to this, please do not hesitate to get in contact wtih me.)
